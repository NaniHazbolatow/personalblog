  <p>Sometimes itâ€™s worth getting lost to see who will come looking for us.</p>

<p>Next you can try &amp; find something interesting at <strong><a href="/">my site</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Or you can do a <strong><a href="/search">site search</a></strong> if youâ€™re looking for something particular.</p>
