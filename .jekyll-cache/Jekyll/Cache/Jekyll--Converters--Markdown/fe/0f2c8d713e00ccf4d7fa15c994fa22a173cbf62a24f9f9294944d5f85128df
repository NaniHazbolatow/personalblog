I"<p>In all probability it ain’t the page you are looking for.</p>

<p>But as Robert Breault once said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it’s worth getting lost to see who will come looking for us.</p>

<p>Since you’re here anyway, why not say hello to Roscoe the pug dog!</p>

<p>Next you can try &amp; find something interesting at <strong><a href="/">my site</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Or you can do a <strong><a href="/search">site search</a></strong> if you’re looking for something particular.</p>
