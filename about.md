Hi, welcome to my website! I'm Ernani Hazbolatow, a part-time (social data) scientist. The purpose of this website is two-fold. First, this website serves as a landing page about me and what I am interested in. Secondly, this website provides detailed markdown posts on many of my projects on my [Github](https://github.com/NaniHazbolatow). 

Feel free to contact me via <ernanihazbolatow123@outlook.com> for any inquiries!
