Hi, Welcome to my blog!

I'm Ernani Hazbolatow, a part-time (social) data scientist. Although I have primarily worked with data from the social sciences during my education, my interest stretch far beyond those. 

The purpose of this website is twofold. First, this website serves as an introduction to myself. Secondly, this website provides detailed markdown posts on some of my projects on Github.

For any inquiries, feel free to contact me at my [e-mail]<ernanihazbolatow123@outlook.com> or my [LinkedIn]<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernani-hazbolatow-834182177/>.
